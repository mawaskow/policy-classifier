facilitate the development of offshore renewable energy to progress at pace alongside the conservation, protection, and recovery of marine biodiversityCurrent and Future Action• We will support the new State-led consenting regime for the maritime area by establishing a new Maritime Area Regulatory Authority; adopting a statutory Marine Planning Policy Statement; developing Marine Planning Guidelines; progressing designation of marine Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Area sites; and the mapping of all Irish offshore waters through the INFOMAR Programme• We will develop comprehensive stand-alone legislation for the identification, designation, and management of Marine Protected Areas in Ireland’s maritime area, which will include comprehensive criteria for nature-based carbon storage and resilience to climate change, and ocean acidification• We will develop national marine climate indicators to monitor and assess the effects of climate change on the marine environment and develop a pilot national monitoring and assessment programme to assess the effects of climate change• We will advance marine adaptation and mitigation by: developing the new National Marine Research and Innovation Strategy, Ocean Knowledge 2030; continuing to progress investment in research to address marine climate change issues; developing climate adaptation tools to guide future policy making and protection strategies for our coastal communities and seafood infrastructure; examining the reduction of fossil fuel dependency across the fishery harbours centres; and

TO THE SDGS18SDG National Implementation PlanSDG Vision and PrioritiesMeaningful implementation of the SDGs at the national level requires that each country, guided by the level of global ambition reflected in the Goals, defines what constitutes successful achievement of the SDGs in light of its national circumstancesAs a highly developed country with a deep commitment to global cooperation and to the SDGs in particular, Ireland has an ambitious vision for achieving the Goals by 2030Our 2030 vision for Ireland is of a country:u defined by its commitment to ensuring that all citizens have the opportunity to reach their full potential at every stage of their lives;u that is just, equitable and socially inclusive, that protects its most vulnerable citizens and where no citizen, regardless of gender, age, family status, civil status, sexual orientation, race, disability, religion or membership of the Traveller Community faces discrimination or barriers to their full participation in society;u that plans for and accommodates its growing population in a manner that sustainably fosters, enhances and integrates existing and new communities, that improves our quality of life and the quality of our shared environment and that provides tailored housing supports and State assistance in ensuring access to good quality, safe homes for its residents;u where a robust national economy delivers shared prosperity, sustainable growth and decent jobs and, together with sustainable management of the public finances, provides the funding to pay for comprehensive services and public investment;u that is supported by an effective, resilient and responsive public service that engages with the public in an open and accountable manner to ensure their needs are central to policy development and high-quality service delivery;u where the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected and fulfilled; where their voices are heard and where they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and in the future;u where older people enjoy a comfortable standard of living, their dignity respected, and they can live independently in their own homes and communities for as long as possible or have equitable access to high-quality long-term residential care where needed;u with an education and training system that has become the best in Europe and which; harnesses education to break down barriers for groups at risk of exclusion; delivers a learning experience to highest international standards; equips learners of all ages and capacities to participate and succeed in a changing world; and allows Ireland to be a leader across a broad range of fields, scientific, cultural, enterprise and public service;u where people’s health and well-being is maximised, by keeping people healthy, reducing health inequalities, providing the healthcare people need, delivering high-quality services, and getting best value from health system resources;u that is on-track to achieving a transition to a competitive, low carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050, while also addressing the issue of energy poverty, supported by investment in renewable energy and sustainable transport, together with improvements in the energy efficiency of the built environment;u that protects and preserves its terrestrial, freshwater and marine biodiversity;19CHAPTER 2 IRELAND’S NATIONAL APPROACH TO THE SDGSSDG National Implementation Planu that has embedded a pattern of sustainable consumption and production in its economic systems;u with food production systems which show absolute commitment to the principles of sustainability, and which acknowledges that environmental protection and economic competitiveness are equal and complementary – one will not be achieved at the expense of the other; andu that continues to work for a fairer, more just, more secure, more sustainable world, and to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, disarmament, and international peacekeeping, as well as addressing extreme poverty, hunger and malnutritionIn the context of this 2030 vision, the following strategies are useful examples of Ireland’s domestic SDG implementation during the lifetime of this Plan:u Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessnessu Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Frameworku Project Ireland 2040: National Development Plan 2018-2027u National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020u Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy

10-Year Vision for the Irish Agri-food Industryu National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020While highlighting the particular relevance of these strategies, Ireland nonetheless
