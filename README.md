This repository is based on the repository[https://github.com/wri-dssg-omdena/policy-data-analyzer] behind this paper[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389934121002306]. All original functions and comparison to original workflow will be articulated.

In the original repository, the focus was a pipeline for finding and classifying incentives in Latin American Forestry Policies. 
In this repository, we are aiming for a [multi-lingual] model that can evalaute 

**A** policies which affect peatlands, 

**B** policies based on their conceptual domain/department of origin (e.g. Biodiversity, Economy, Land Use, etc), and 

**C** policies based on the kind of peatland they apply to (e.g. raised bog, blanket bog, etc). In each of these cases, we want to fulfill the tasks of classification and span detection (i.e. what sentences in the policy indicate the classification).
